# The ISC-GEM Global Instrumental Earthquake Catalogue contains:
# - earthquake origin date and time;
# - epicentre (lat,lon);
# - error ellipse parameters (smajax, sminax, strike), epicentre quality,
# (q:A(highest)/B/C);
# - depth, depth uncertainty (unc), depth quality (q:A(highest)/B/C);
# - Mw, Mw uncertainty (unc), quality (q:A(highest)/B/C), source(s:p-proxy,
# d-direct computation);
# - where available: scalar moment (mo), factor (fac) , mo author (mo_auth)
# and six moment tensor components (mpp, mpr, mrr, mrt, mtp, mtt).
#
# The Supplement to the Catalogue is provided in a separate file. The Supplement
# contains a list of those earthquakes for which poor data availability
# prevented the authors from performing a reliable determination of either
# the epicentre or the magnitude parameters or both.
